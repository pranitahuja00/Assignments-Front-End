      <h3>A time-line of the life of Dr. Alan Turing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1912 - </span>Born in Maida Vale, London, England
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1918 - </span>Turing joins St Michael’s day school in
          Hastings, where he does not do very well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1922 - </span>Turing is sent to Hazelhurst
          Preparatory School where he does much better and learns to play chess.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1926-1931 - </span>He went on to Sherborne School, a
          well-known independent school in the market town of Sherborne in
          Dorset. His teachers were concerned that he leaned too heavily towards
          maths and science, at the expense of the classics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1928 - </span>Turing encountered Albert Einstein‘s
          work; not only did he grasp it, but he extrapolated Einstein’s
          questioning of Newton’s laws of motion from a text in which this was
          never made explicit. Turing enters 6th form at Sherborne and becomes
          great friends with Christopher Morcom, another talented boy who loves
          Maths and Science.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1930 - </span>Turing’s close school friend
          Christopher Morcom dies suddenly from bovine tuberculosis. Turing is
          devastated, renounces his religious faith and becomes an atheist.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1931-1934 - </span>Enters King’s College, Cambridge,
          as mathematics scholar. He gained first-class honours in Mathematics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1935 - </span>Elected fellow of King’s College for
          his dissertation “Central Limit Theorem of Probability” Turing
          attended Max Newman‘s advanced course on the foundations of
          mathematics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1936 - </span>Submitted on 28 May 1936 and delivered
          12 November to London Mathematical Society: On Computable Numbers,
          with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) in
          which he outlines the Universal Machine, which later became known as
          the Turing Machine. This was an idealised computing device that is
          capable of performing any mathematical computation that can be
          represented as an algorithm. There cannot exist any universal method
          of decision and, hence, mathematics will always contain undecidable
          (as opposed to unknown) propositions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1936-1938 - </span>In September Turing went to the
          Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton, studying under Alonzo
          Church. There he started to study cryptology as well as mathematics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1938 - </span>He obtained his PhD from Princeton
          University; his Ph.D. thesis under the direction of the American
          mathematician Alonzo Church, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals,
          introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative
          computing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1939 - </span>Turing is asked to join the Government
          Codes and Ciphers School and arrives at Bletchley Park the day after
          war is declared. There he worked with Gordon Welchman to develop the
          Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by Germans using
          their Enigma machines. Many of Germany’s secret messages could be
          deciphered and read with it. The periods when the Naval code could be
          broken saw dramatic reductions in the shipping losses from the
          Atlantic convoys so essential to the conduct of the Allied war effort.
          Turing used statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different
          possibilities in the code-breaking process using probability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1940 - </span>First Turing Bombe is installed at
          Bletchley Park.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1941 - </span>Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8
          co-worker Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but
          their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to
          his fiancée, who was reportedly “unfazed” by the revelation, Turing
          decided that he could not go through with the marriage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1942 - </span>Turing and his colleagues break the
          more complicated German Naval Enigma system. This is a tremendous help
          to the Allies in the Battle of the Atlantic as it could help them
          avoid the fearsome German U-boats, which had been responsible for
          sinking more than 700 Allied ships with 2.3 million tons of vital
          cargo. Turing travelled to the United States in November and worked
          with U.S. Navy cryptanalysts on Naval Enigma and bombe construction in
          Washington, visiting their Computing Machine Laboratory at Dayton,
          Ohio. He shared what he knew about Enigma in return for being allowed
          to inspect the speech encryption system being set up to allow
          conversations between Churchill and Roosevelt. Turing was somewhat
          dismissive of US cryptanalysis, believing the Americans to rely too
          heavily on machinery instead of thought.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1943 - </span>Turing is asked to work as a top level
          intelligence link with USA, which he visits to share information on
          cryptology (code-breaking). Works at Bell Laboratories on speech
          encypherment.

          <span class="tl">1944 - </span>Colossus, the world’s first large-scale
          electronic computer, is installed at Bletchley Park.

        <li>
          <span class="tl">1945 - </span>Turing’s ‘Proposed Electronic
          Calculator‘ is circulated, setting out the design of the ACE
          (Automatic Computing Engine). In it, he suggests that computers will
          ‘play very good chess‘. Published “A Method for the Calculation of the
          Zeta-Function”, which constitutes his first printed contribution to
          the subject. Turing was awarded the OBE for his wartime services, but
          his work remained secret for many years. October: Turing joined the
          National Physical Laboratory (NPL) where he worked on developing an
          electronic digital stored-program computing machine that would later
          become the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine). By 1946 he had a finished
          proposal for the computer, but NPL did not have the resources to turn
          it into reality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1946 - </span>19 February, published the first
          detailed design of a stored-program computer. Turing and his group
          pioneer modern computer programming, writing a library of
          sophisticated programs for the unbuilt ACE. Turing presents a course
          of lectures on Versions V, VI, and VII of the ACE design, at the
          Ministry of Supply in London (Dec. 1946 to Feb. 1947). Kilburn attends
          from Manchester University.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1947 - </span>He returned to Cambridge for a
          sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent
          Machinery that was not published in his lifetime. Turing lectures on
          the ACE at Burlington House in London, the first public lecture to
          mention computer intelligence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1948 - </span>Appointed Reader in the Mathematics
          Department at the University of Manchester. He also invented the LU
          decomposition method in 1948, used today for solving matrix equations.
          Turing, now at Manchester as Deputy Director of the Computing Machine
          Laboratory, writes ‘Intelligent Machinery‘, the first manifesto of
          Artificial Intelligence. Turing joined Max Newman’s Computing
          Laboratory at Manchester University, where he wrote programs for the
          Manchester Automatic Digital Machine (MADAM), the computer with the
          largest memory capacity in the world at that time. Turing, working
          with his former undergraduate colleague, D. G. Champernowne, began
          writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. Lacking
          a computer powerful enough to execute the program, Turing played a
          game in which he simulated the computer, taking about half an hour per
          move. ‘Turochamp’ plays its first game of chess.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1950 - </span>Publishes Computing Machinery and
          Intelligence, introducing a test of intelligence, that he said would
          prove a machine could think. This test later became known as the
          Turing Test. Turing was convinced that if a computer could do all
          mathematical operations, it could also do anything a person can do, a
          still highly controversial opinion. (Mind, October 1950), Turing
          addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed an
          experiment which became known as the Turing test, an attempt to define
          a standard for a machine to be called “intelligent”. The Turing Test
          has a computer and a person with the interrogator trying to
          distinguish which is the computer. The interrorgator asks questions
          via teletype so no visual identification can be made. The test is
          repeated with a range of people in the human position and if the
          number of times that repeated identification is less than pure
          guesswork then the machine has passed.

        <li>
          <span class="tl">1951 - </span>Turing is elected Fellow of the Royal
          Society FRS and also gives a talk about Artificial Intelligence on the
          BBC radio’s Third Programme.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="tl">1952 - </span>Turing is arrested for gross indecency
          and loses his security clearance. Turing’s homosexuality resulted in a
          criminal prosecution in 1952, when homosexual acts were still illegal
          in the United Kingdom. He is offered chemical treatment as an
          alternative to imprisonment. The hormone treatment has a very
          detrimental effect on him.

          Wilmslow, Cheshire, England. June 8th – Turing’s body is found in his
          home in Wilmslow, Cheshire. The post-mortem finds that his death had
          been caused by cyanide poisoning. His body is cremated at Woking
          crematorium.
